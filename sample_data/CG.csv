S-3-apyr,(S)-3-aminopyrrolidine,,,o,"js: (i) really? easy to add, but want to make sure this is true; (ii)   please let's not put parentheses in the abbreviation names because it screws up my scheme for storing the optimized geometries on disk; I changed the reaction chart to account for this","GMN: I didn't know what abbreviation to use, so I wrote it as this for now.

So 1,2-aepip?","ajn:  there is no 1,2-aep.  It's just aep.",js:  No problem.  We can have two sets of abbreviations for the same thing; I will just give it the same IUPAC name as aep
